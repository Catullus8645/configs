I have set alt as the main MOD key and windows key is the SUP key
Most of the mod bindings are to do with window manipulation, while sup bindings are for launching apps

## Window Manipulation
- mod+q kill focused window
- mod+v vertical windows
- mod+p screenshot whole screen
- sup+p screenshot focused window
- mod+shift+space floating mode
- mod+x lock screen

sup  z    resize 640x360 

## Application Launchers
alt  ent  alacritty
sup  ent  terminator
alt  d    dmenu
sup  f    firefox
sup  e    pcmanfm
sup  l    spotify
sup  u    units
sup  p    python
sup  k    ksnip
alt  p    screenshot

### Not currently installed
sup  c    qalculate-gtk
sup  x    calcurse
