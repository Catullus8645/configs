I have set alt as the main MOD key and windows key is the SUP key
Most of the mod bindings are to do with window manipulation, while sup bindings are for launching apps

Some of the main bindings
- mod+enter alacritty
- mod+q kill focused window
- mod+v vertical windows
- mod+d dmenu
- mod+p screenshot whole screen
- sup+p screenshot focused window
- mod+shift+space floating mode
- mod+x lock screen
- sup+c open rhythmbox
- sup+e open pcmanfm
- sup+f open firefox
